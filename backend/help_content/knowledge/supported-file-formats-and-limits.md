# Supported file formats and limits

The current knowledge upload flow supports a small, explicit set of document types.

## Supported uploads

- **PDF** (`.pdf`)
- **Microsoft Word DOCX** (`.docx`)
- **Plain text** (`.txt`)
- **Markdown** (`.md` or `.markdown`)

## Important limits

- Maximum uploaded file size: **25 MB** by default.
- Maximum PDF pages: **500** by default.
- Maximum extracted text: **2,000,000 characters** by default.
- Maximum generated chunks per source: **2,000** by default.
- Maximum uncompressed DOCX content: **100 MB** by default.

These backend values are configurable within guarded ranges, so a specific deployment can intentionally use different limits.

## Troubleshooting

If an accepted extension is rejected, make sure the file's declared content type matches the filename and the file is not larger than the configured limit.
